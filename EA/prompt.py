    ## Step 1: Analyze the Input Prompts
    First, analyze the prompts of agents. These prompts are designed to guide each agent in solving complex problems, and your goal is to combine them effectively while maintaining the distinctiveness and strengths of each one. Each agent has a specific task, such as solving engineering challenges, optimizing algorithms, or enhancing data-driven solutions.

    ## Step 2: Perform Crossover (Combination of Prompts)
    To begin the **crossover** operation, select two or more agent prompts and combine them to form a new prompt. Follow these guidelines:

    1. **Select Prompts for Crossover**: Choose two or more prompts that you believe complement each other in terms of the type of task they address (e.g., combining problem-solving with efficiency, or data analysis with optimization).

    2. **Blend Key Features**: Focus on blending the key elements from each selected prompt. Retain the essential instructions (such as focusing on efficiency or accuracy) and merge them in a way that creates a new prompt. The final result should incorporate strengths from both agents, ensuring that the new prompt still feels coherent and natural.

    3. **Create New Prompt**: After blending key elements, write a new, merged prompt that captures the core tasks from each selected prompt but delivers them in a unified instruction. This new prompt should be detailed and robust, ensuring the agent can tackle the problem with both breadth and depth.

    ## Step 3: Perform Mutation (Alteration of Prompts)
    For the **mutation** operation, you will modify a single prompt slightly, ensuring the agentâ€™s personality and task remain intact. The goal is to add variety while keeping the original focus.

    1. **Select Prompt for Mutation**: Pick a prompt to mutate. This could be any of the agent prompts, but ideally, choose one that you think would benefit from slight modification (e.g., enhancing the clarity or adding a new emphasis).

    2. **Modify Key Elements**: Change specific details of the prompt, such as the tone, focus, or task instructions. You could:
       - Adjust the level of detail in the task.
       - Change the type of problem-solving approach.
       - Alter the way the agent should think about optimization or solution delivery.
       - Please ensure the mutation is accurate and clear.

    3. **Maintain Coherence**: Ensure that after mutation, the prompt still makes sense. The agent should be able to understand the modified task and perform it with accuracy and efficiency.

    ## Step 4: After mutation and crossover, Make sure the prompt is at least 50 words long.
    
    ## Step 5: Final Output - Generating New Prompts for the Agents
    After performing both crossover and mutation, ensure that the final set of prompts consists of exactly 7 agents. The goal is to **maintain diversity** while ensuring that each agent is well-equipped to handle its task.

    ### Final Notes:
    - After the crossover and mutation steps, you should have 7 distinct agent prompts. Ensure that each prompt is tailored to guide the agent in solving complex problems, while being unique enough to give each agent a distinctive focus or expertise.
    - Each prompt should still be coherent, instructive, and specific enough to allow the agent to perform tasks effectively and efficiently.

    ### Expected Final Format for Returned Prompts:

    - Return the final list of 7 agents as follows:
      ```
      Agent 1: "You <Merged prompt for Agent 1>"
      Agent 2: "You <Merged prompt for Agent 2>"
      Agent 3: "You <Merged prompt for Agent 3>"
      Agent 4: "You <Merged prompt for Agent 4>"
      Agent 5: "You <Merged prompt for Agent 5>"
      Agent 6: "You <Merged prompt for Agent 6>"
      Agent 7: "You <Merged prompt for Agent 7>"
      ```
    """
